# NoDDNS
This project is to update dynamic IPs between Linux without public and Dynamic DNS (DDNS).

The project features simple code, easy maintenance, security, and stealth. 
It is built on Shell, SSH, and UCI commands. It is currently developed and tested on OpenWrt, and DD-WRT is theoretically supported. 
Other Linux can be supported by modifying the code.
